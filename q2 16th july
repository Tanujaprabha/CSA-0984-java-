2. Write a program to find whether the person is eligible for vote or not. And if that particular person is not eligible, then print how many years are left to be eligible.
Sample Input:
 Enter your age:
7
Sample output:
You are allowed to vote after 11 years

import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;
class age
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int age;
Scanner n = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("enter ur age");
age = n.nextInt();
if (age > 18)
System.out.print("your eligiable to vote");
else
System.out.print("you have still" +(18 - age) +  "to vote");
}
}
