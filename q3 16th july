3.Write a program using function to calculate the simple interest. Suppose the customer is a senior citizen. He is being offered 12 percent rate of interest; for all other customers, the ROI is 10 percent.
Sample Input:
Enter the principal amount: 200000
Enter the no of years:  3
Is customer senior citizen (y/n): n
Sample Output:
Interest:Â 60000

import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;
class citizen
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int p,N,a;
String citi;
Scanner n = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("enter Principal and year");
p = n.nextInt();
N = n.nextInt();
System.out.print("is customer senior citizen(y/n):");
citi = n.next();
if (citi == "y")
a = (p*N*12)/100;
else
a = (p*N*10)/100;
System.out.print("simple interest is : " +a);
}
}
